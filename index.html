        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. <br>Their earliest works were influenced by
            progressive
            rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly
            works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.</p>

            <p>Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band <em>Smile</em>. <br>Mercury was a
                fan of
                <em>Smile</em> and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques.
                <br>He
                joined in
                1970 and
                suggested the name "Queen". <br>Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their
                eponymous
                debut album in 1973. <br>Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, <em>Queen II</em>, in
                1974.
                <br><em>Sheer Heart Attack</em> later that year and <em>A Night at the Opera</em> in 1975 brought them
                international
                success. </p>

        <h2>Bohemian rhapsody - a tribute</h2>
        <img src="images/Queen_live_aid.jpg" alt="Remi Malek as Freddy Mercury" width="500">
        <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 biographical drama film about Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British
            rock band Queen. <br>It was directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten, and produced by
            Graham King and Queen manager Jim Beach. <br>The film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018
            and
            in the United States on 2 November 2018. <br>It received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayals of
            Mercury's
            sexuality and lives of the other band members were criticised, but Malek's performance and the music
            sequences received praise. <br>The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies. <br>It became a
            major box office success, grossing over <strong>$903 million</strong> worldwide on a production budget of
            about $50 million,
            becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide and setting the all-time box office records for
            the biographical film and drama genres.</p>
