        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their earliest works were influenced by
            progressive
            rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly
            works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.</p>
        <p>Some of their most popular songs are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bohemian Rhapsody</li>
            <li>I Want To Break Free</li>
            <li>Radio Ga Ga</li>
            <li>We Are The Champions</li>
            <li>and many others</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Line-up:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Freddie Mercury (lead vocals and piano) </li>
            <li>Brian May (lead guitar and vocals)</li>
            <li>Roger Taylor (drums and vocals)</li>
            <li>John Deacon (bass guitar)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. <br>Mercury was a fan of Smile
            and
            encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. <br>He joined in 1970 and
            suggested the name "Queen". <br>Deacon was recruited in March 1971, before the band released their eponymous
            debut album in 1973. <br>Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. <br>Sheer
            Heart
            Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. </p>
        <h2>Bohemian rhapsody - a tribute</h2>
        <img src="images/Queen_live_aid.jpg" alt="Remi Malek as Freddy Mercury" width="500">
        <p>Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 biographical drama film about Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British
            rock band Queen. <br>It was directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten, and produced by
            Graham King and Queen manager Jim Beach. <br>The film was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018
            and
            in the United States on 2 November 2018. <br>It received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayals of
            Mercury's
            sexuality and lives of the other band members were criticised, but Malek's performance and the music
            sequences received praise. <br>The film also contains a number of historical inaccuracies. <br>It became a
            major box office success, grossing over $903 million worldwide on a production budget of about $50 million,
            becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide and setting the all-time box office records for
            the biographical film and drama genres.</p>
